📌 Project Overview
The Hospital Emergency Room Dashboard is a comprehensive data visualization project developed using Power BI and Excel, aimed at monitoring and analyzing key aspects of patient flow and performance within an emergency room setting. Using a publicly available dataset containing records of 9,216 patients, the dashboard provides a real-time analytical view of patient visits, satisfaction levels, wait times, and referral statistics.

The goal of this project is to equip hospital administrators and healthcare analysts with actionable insights to improve decision-making, reduce patient wait times, enhance satisfaction, and efficiently allocate emergency care resources.# HOSPITAL-EMERGENCY-ROOM-DASHBOARD

🛠 Tools & Technologies Used
Power BI: For creating dynamic and interactive data visualizations, KPI cards, and dashboards.

Microsoft Excel: For preprocessing the dataset including cleaning, structuring, and preparing data for Power BI ingestion.

Internet-sourced dataset: Contains over 9,200 patient records with detailed demographic, operational, and satisfaction metrics.

📌Dataset Description
The dataset used in this project simulates real-world emergency room operations and includes the following key columns:

Patient ID: Unique identifier for each patient

Admission Date: Date of ER visit

Patient Name: First initial and last name

Gender and Age

Race

Department Referral: Indicates source of referral or triage

Admission Flag: Whether the patient was admitted

Patient Satisfaction Score (1 to 5)

Wait Time: Time (in minutes) between arrival and being seen

Patients CM: Case management details

📊 Dashboard Features
The dashboard is designed with usability and insights in mind. It includes:

KPI Cards: Instantly show total patient visits, average wait time, patient satisfaction score, and number of referrals.

Interactive Slicers: Users can filter the data by gender and date, allowing for deep dive analysis into specific patient groups or time frames.

Visuals Used: Donut Charts, Clustered Bar Charts, Stacked Area Charts, Matrix Table, Stacked Column Charts

📈 Key Metrics Tracked
The dashboard focuses on the following crucial performance indicators:

Total Patient Visits per Day: Tracks volume of ER traffic, helping anticipate staffing needs.

Average Wait Time: Measures efficiency in patient handling, with an average of 36 minutes.

Patient Satisfaction Score: Captures quality of care perception, with an average score of 4.5/5.

Number of Patient Referrals: Assesses how many patients were referred by other departments or clinics.

Each KPI is updated dynamically based on user interaction with slicers and filters.

🔍 Key Insights
Through visual analytics and filters, the dashboard uncovers several meaningful insights:

📈 Patient Volume: The highest number of patient arrivals occur on Thursdays, suggesting a mid-week peak in emergency visits.

👨 Gender Breakdown: Male patients slightly outnumber female patients in ER visits, which could influence staffing and care considerations.

🧑🏽‍⚕️ Race Distribution: A majority of patients belong to the White racial group, helping understand demographic patterns.

⭐ Satisfaction Scores: The average satisfaction score is 4.5, indicating that most patients are generally happy with their ER experience.

⏱️ Wait Times: Despite high visit volumes, the average wait time is just 36 minutes, suggesting an efficient triage and care process.

These insights can help hospital administrators and decision-makers take targeted actions to improve emergency services.

✅ Benefits of the Dashboard
The Hospital Emergency Room Dashboard offers several practical benefits for healthcare professionals:

Operational Optimization: Identifies peak hours and bottlenecks in patient flow to help allocate staff and resources efficiently.

Improved Patient Experience: Enables monitoring of satisfaction scores and wait times, directly tied to patient outcomes.

Data-Driven Decisions: Empowers hospital leadership to make strategic decisions using real-time data.

Transparency and Accountability: Encourages better performance through visible metrics and trends.

Scalability: The model and design can be extended to other hospital departments (e.g., OPD, surgery, ICU) or even to multiple branches.
